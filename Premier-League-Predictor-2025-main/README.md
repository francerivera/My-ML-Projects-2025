# English Premier League (EPL) Match Winner Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the winners of English Premier League (EPL) football matches using web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning techniques. We'll scrape historical match data, clean and prepare it for model training, and then use scikit-learn to build a predictive model. Finally, we'll evaluate the model's performance and explore potential improvements.

## Project Steps

1.  **Data Scraping:** We'll use `requests` to fetch HTML data from a website containing EPL match results, `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML, and `pandas` to organize the scraped data into DataFrames.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** The scraped data will be cleaned and transformed using `pandas`. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, and potentially creating new features.
3.  **Model Building and Prediction:** We'll use `scikit-learn` to train a machine learning model to predict match outcomes (win, loss, or draw). This may involve exploring different algorithms and tuning hyperparameters.
4.  **Model Evaluation and Improvement:** We'll assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and explore ways to improve its predictive accuracy.

## Code

You can find the code for this project in this repository.

### File Overview:

*   **`scraping.ipynb`:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for scraping EPL match data from the web. It handles fetching the HTML, parsing it with BeautifulSoup, and storing the data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or a pandas DataFrame).
*   **`predictions.ipynb`:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It uses scikit-learn to build the predictive model.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

*   `requests`
*   `beautifulsoup4`
*   `pandas`
*   `scikit-learn`
*   `numpy` (likely a dependency of pandas/scikit-learn but good to be explicit)

You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas scikit-learn numpy
