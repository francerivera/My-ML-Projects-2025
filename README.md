# My Machine Learning Projects - 2025

## Overview

This repository is a collection of my machine learning projects completed in 2025.

## What's Included

This repository contains various machine learning projects I've worked on throughout 2025. Each project will have its own directory, potentially including:

- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) containing the core implementation and experimentation.
- Python scripts (.py) for specific functions or reusable code components.
- Data files (.csv, .txt, etc.) used in the projects.
- README files (.md) providing project-specific details and instructions.

## Learning Goals

By undertaking these projects, I aimed to:

- Solidify my understanding of core machine learning concepts (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, etc.).
- Gain practical experience implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- Explore various machine learning libraries and tools (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).
- Develop effective data analysis and visualization techniques tailored to machine learning tasks.

## Project Exploration

Feel free to browse the subdirectories within this repository to explore the individual projects. Each project's README file (if provided) will offer specific details about its purpose, approach, and any relevant results.

## Disclaimer

This repository serves as a personal record of my machine learning journey in 2025. The code might not always be production-ready or perfectly optimized. However, it reflects my learning process and experimentation during that time.
